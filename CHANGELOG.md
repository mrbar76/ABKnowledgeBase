## [1.8.11] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed — Macros tab still showed "active null · basal null"

v1.8.10 added BMR fallback to `/insights/nutrition/macros/today`, but the Macros tab in the Fitness UI actually calls a different endpoint: `/health/insights/nutrition?days=14&date=...`. That endpoint was unchanged, so it returned `calories_out` summed correctly but never exposed `calories_active`, `calories_basal`, `basal_source`, or `last_synced_at`. UI saw `undefined` and rendered "active null · basal null" even when the underlying numbers were fine.

Patched `/health/insights/nutrition` (`router.get('/nutrition')`) so every `history[]` entry now carries:
- `calories_active` — real active from `daily_activity.active_energy_kcal`
- `calories_basal` — real basal OR BMR fallback (Mifflin-St Jeor)
- `basal_source` — `'apple_health'` | `'bmr_estimated'` | `null`
- `last_synced_at` — `daily_activity.updated_at`

Same BMR fallback rules as v1.8.10: latest weight from RENPHO + `USER_HEIGHT_CM` / `USER_AGE` / `USER_SEX` env vars (defaults 175 cm / 38 yo / male). Pro-rated by elapsed-day fraction for "today"; full BMR for past dates.

After deploy, hard-refresh the Macros tab — the OUT line will read like:
> `1757 burned (basal 1757 est.) · synced —`

(active will still be `null` if HAE hasn't synced any active energy for the day yet — that's not BMR's job).

---

## [1.8.10] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed — OUT/balance calculation no longer depends on HAE supplying basal

After v1.8.8 (Format A basal capture) + v1.8.9 (diagnostic visibility), basal was still null because **HAE's daily payload simply doesn't include basal_energy_kcal** in many configs. User-visible result: workout days showed less "burned" than rest days, because the dominant ~1,800 kcal/day BMR component was missing from both.

**Solution: stop depending on HAE for basal entirely.** When `basal_energy_kcal` is null, AB Brain now computes BMR via Mifflin-St Jeor:

```
BMR_kcal = 10·weight_kg + 6.25·height_cm − 5·age + (sex == 'male' ? +5 : -161)
```

Inputs:
- **Weight** — latest from `body_metrics` (RENPHO scale)
- **Height** — `USER_HEIGHT_CM` env var, default **175 cm**
- **Age** — `USER_AGE` env var, default **38**
- **Sex** — `USER_SEX` env var, default **male**

For `today`, BMR is pro-rated by elapsed-day fraction so 8 AM doesn't show a full-day basal. For past dates, full BMR.

**API response (`/insights/nutrition/macros/today`):**
- `calories_basal` — populated either from HAE or from BMR fallback
- `basal_source` — `'apple_health'` | `'bmr_estimated'` | `null` so clients can show provenance

**UI:** OUT line now reads `OUT 3275 burned (active 1526 · basal 1749 est.) · synced 12m ago`. The `est.` tag (with explanatory tooltip) shows up only when basal came from BMR. When HAE supplies real basal, no tag.

**Edge case handled:** if `daily_activity` row doesn't exist yet for today (HAE hasn't synced anything), AB Brain still injects a BMR-only OUT estimate so the Macros tab isn't suspiciously empty in the morning.

### Action — set your real profile (optional, recommended)

Defaults give a reasonable estimate (~1,800 kcal BMR for a 90 kg adult male). For accuracy, set on Railway:

```
USER_HEIGHT_CM=180
USER_AGE=42
USER_SEX=male
```

Then redeploy. The estimate adjusts on the next request.

---

## [1.8.9] — 2026-05-03

### Added — visibility into why OUT looks wrong on the Macros tab

v1.8.8 fixed Format A's missing basal capture, but if HAE never sends `basalEnergyKcal` in its payloads (config issue) OR uses a different field name, reparse won't help. Hard to diagnose without seeing the raw data.

- **`OUT` line now shows breakdown:** `OUT 3275 burned (active 1526 · basal 1749) · synced 12m ago`. If basal is null, the chip shows `basal null` in amber with a tooltip explaining what's missing.
- **`/api/health/diagnose-day?date=YYYY-MM-DD`** — new endpoint that dumps:
  - The `daily_activity` row for the date
  - The 5 most recent `raw_health_imports` covering that date
  - **For each import, every payload field with `basal/active/energy/calorie/kcal` in its key** — so you can see exactly what HAE exported under what name
  - A plain-language `diagnosis` string explaining what's null and why
- `/insights/nutrition/macros/today` response gains `calories_active`, `calories_basal`, and `last_synced_at` fields under `today`.

If after deploy + reparse the OUT chip still shows `basal null`, hit `/api/health/diagnose-day?date=2026-05-03` to see whether your HAE export config sends Basal Energy Burned at all. If `energy_fields_in_payload` doesn't include any basal-related entry, enable that metric in the HAE app settings.

---

## [1.8.8] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed — Macros tab "OUT" massively under-counts vs Apple Health

Apple Health showed total burned today = 3,275 cal. AB Brain Macros tab showed `OUT 520 · BALANCE +2875`. Result: every training day looked like a 1,500–3,000 kcal surplus when reality was balanced or in deficit. Energy-balance recommendations were wildly wrong.

**Root cause:** Format A daily-activity ingest at `routes/health.js:198` captured `activeEnergyKcal` but **omitted `basalEnergyKcal`**. Format B (line ~714) parsed both. Depending on which HAE export shape your iPhone pushed, basal was silently dropped.

The Macros math is `OUT = active + basal`. With basal null, OUT = active only ≈ 500–1500 kcal, missing the ~1,500–2,000 kcal/day BMR that Apple includes in its "TOTAL CAL" display.

**Fix:** added `basal_energy_kcal: d.basalEnergyKcal ?? null` to the Format A daily row. Format B was already correct. The `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` upsert in `daily_activity` writes via `COALESCE(existing, new)` so a Reparse All will backfill historical days where basal was null.

### Action required after deploy
1. **Settings → Reparse Health Imports → Reparse All** — backfills `basal_energy_kcal` on historical days from stored raw payloads.
2. Verify on the Macros tab: `OUT` should now match Apple's "Total CAL" (within ±200 kcal due to ingest timing).
3. If `OUT` is still much lower than Apple, run this SQL to inspect:
   ```sql
   SELECT activity_date, active_energy_kcal, basal_energy_kcal
   FROM daily_activity
   ORDER BY activity_date DESC LIMIT 7;
   ```
   If `basal_energy_kcal` is null even after reparse, your HAE export config isn't sending Basal Energy Burned — enable it in the HAE app settings.

## [1.8.7] — 2026-05-03

### Added — Apple Watch enrichment chip on Hevy workout rows

Hevy doesn't return heart rate or calories (verified against the OAS — only `start_time/end_time/exercises/sets`). Those fields only land in the AB Brain `workouts` row when `dedupeAppleWorkouts()` merges an Apple Watch workout into the Hevy row by overlapping `started_at`. Without a chip, you couldn't tell if the watch picked up your lift or not.

- **`✓ Watch HR+kcal`** (green) — both HR and active calories merged from HAE
- **`✓ Watch HR`** / **`✓ Watch kcal`** (green) — partial sync
- **`⚠ no watch data`** (amber) — Hevy row has no Apple data; either watch wasn't tracking or HAE hasn't synced yet (typically 5–30 min lag)

Chip only renders for Hevy-sourced workouts (`source='hevy'` or `hevy_id IS NOT NULL`). Apple Health and manual workouts get the data natively, so the chip would be redundant.

Active calories also now show in the workout meta line alongside HR / duration / distance when available.

---

## [1.8.6] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed — every Today-card exercise showed "⚠ unresolved"

When Coach writes segment `planned_exercises` with `name` only (no `hevy_exercise_template_id`), the resolver in `pushSegmentToHevy` fills IDs **at push time** so the Hevy routine gets the right templates. But the resolver only mutated the in-memory copy — it never wrote IDs back to `plan_segments.planned_exercises`. Result: push works, but every render of the Today card shows amber "⚠ unresolved" forever, because the chip checks `ex.hevy_exercise_template_id` which is still null in the DB.

Two fixes:

- **Push-time persistence** (`routes/hevy.js`) — after `resolveTemplateIds()` mutates the array, if any IDs were filled in, persist the new `planned_exercises` JSONB back to the segment row. From the next render onward, chips show green "→ Hevy: \<Title\>".
- **Render-time fallback** (`routes/training.js`) — when the Today endpoint sees an exercise without `hevy_exercise_template_id`, try the sticky `hevy_exercise_map` first, then `hevy_template_cache` exact-title match. Cover plans created before v1.8.6 (display-only enrichment; does NOT write back — push handles that).

Both passes only run for segments with `logging_target='hevy'`. Cardio / manual segments are untouched.

---

## [1.8.5] — 2026-05-03

### Changed — naming is Coach's job, not the system's
v1.8.4 quietly auto-disambiguated colliding routine titles by appending "Strength 1" / "Strength 2". That hid Coach mistakes. Removed: now the system pushes whatever Coach gave it, and surfaces title collisions in the push response so Coach learns to set `title_suffix` properly.
- `pushPlanToHevy()` returns `warnings.title_collisions[]` when two segments share a label without explicit `title_suffix`. Each warning includes the colliding segment IDs and a fix hint pointing at the morning-check-in skill.
- `morning-check-in.skill` updated: `title_suffix` is now documented as REQUIRED when block_labels collide. No silent system rescue.

### Fixed — deploy log noise
Three already-applied migrations were logging errors on every restart because they referenced columns/tables that no longer exist:
- `daily_plans indexes failed: column "training_plan_id" does not exist` — removed the index migration (column was DROPped in v1.8.x cleanup; the index is dead).
- `coaching_sessions indexes failed: column "training_plan_id" does not exist` — same fix.
- `rename dnc→dc failed: relation "daily_context" already exists` — wrapped in a `DO $$ ... END $$` block that checks `information_schema.tables` first.
- `fueling_rehearsals copy g→mg caffeine failed: column "g_caffeine_total" does not exist` — same `DO $$` guard, only runs the UPDATE if the source column is still present.

### Fixed — pg `client.query()` DeprecationWarning
`pool.on('connect', client => client.query('SET timezone...'))` doesn't await the SET, leaving the client in an indeterminate state. Pg 9.0 will reject it. Replaced with `Pool({ options: '-c timezone=...' })` so timezone is set during the protocol startup — no `client.query()` needed, no warning, no race.

---

## [1.8.4] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed — Hevy routine title collisions on multi-segment days

When Coach builds a day with multiple segments sharing a `block_label` (e.g. heavy-pull day = two `block_label='strength'` segments — one for the main lift, one for grip work), the Hevy routine title generator produced **identical names** like:

> Strength A — Heavy Pull + Grip + PT (Strength)
> Strength A — Heavy Pull + Grip + PT (Strength)

Indistinguishable in the AB Brain Plans folder.

### New: `plan_segments.title_suffix`

Coach now sets `title_suffix` on each segment to disambiguate. Hevy routine title becomes `<plan.title> · <title_suffix>`:

- `title_suffix: "Main Lift"` → `"Strength A · Main Lift"`
- `title_suffix: "Grip"` → `"Strength A · Grip"`

If Coach forgets, the server auto-disambiguates by appending `Strength 1` / `Strength 2` based on `block_order` so titles still don't collide.

Schema:
- `plan_segments +title_suffix TEXT` (idempotent ALTER)
- `claude-schema.json` documents the field on segment objects
- `morning-check-in.skill` instructs Coach when to set it

---

## [1.8.3] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed (3 spec bugs surfaced during live testing)

- **Bug #10 — `plan_segments.hevy_routine_id` never written back after push.** Auto-push silently created Hevy routines but the segment row's `hevy_routine_id` stayed null, so subsequent pushes created duplicates instead of updating, and sync couldn't link routines to segments. Root cause: ID extraction was checking only `resp.id`, `resp.routine.id`, `resp.routine_id` — Hevy may also wrap as `resp.data.id` or return a malformed shape. New `extractRoutineId()` tries all five paths and falls back to `GET /v1/routines` to find the just-created routine by title match. Logs the response shape on extraction failure so future regressions are visible.
- **Bug #11 — `daily_plans.hevy_routine_id` is single-valued for multi-segment days.** The column is now stripped from every `/api/daily-plans/*` and `/api/training/day/*` response. Coach + clients only see `plan.segments[].hevy_routine_id`, which is naturally plural across segments. Column kept in DB for one release of soak; will be DROPped in v1.9.0.
- **Bug #12 — `daily_plans.planned_exercises` and `actual_exercises` still surfaced on read despite v1.8.1 deprecation.** Same fix: stripped from every API response. `stripDeprecated()` helper applied at all six daily-plans response sites + the `/training/day` endpoint that the Today UI consumes.

### Added — manual retry path for failed pushes

- **`POST /api/hevy/push-segment`** — push one plan_segment to Hevy by ID. Used for retry when auto-push at plan-create time silently skipped because the template cache was empty.
- **"↑ Push to Hevy" / "↻ Re-push" button** on every Hevy segment block in the Today card. Hovers show the existing `hevy_routine_id` (if any). Re-push updates the existing routine via PUT; first push creates a new one via POST.

### Operational notes
- If you have orphaned routines in Hevy from before v1.8.3 (where the writeback failed), delete them manually in the Hevy app — the API doesn't expose a DELETE endpoint for routines.
- After clicking "Refresh Template Cache" and "Auto-Map Exercises" in Settings, use the per-segment Push button to retry any segment that previously showed "⚠ unresolved" exercises.

---

## [1.8.2] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Settings/Plans `Invalid input syntax for type uuid: "gym-profiles"` toast** — frontend was calling `/api/exercises/gym-profiles*` but the route is mounted at `/api/gym-profiles`. The wrong path fell through to `/exercises/:id` which tried to parse `"gym-profiles"` as a UUID and 500'd. Fixed all four call sites + the Coach init prompt + claude-schema.yaml so Coach won't write the broken path either. Active endpoint is `/gym-profiles/primary` (not `/active`).
- **`HR NaN`** rendering on logged-workout chips — coerced non-numeric HR values via `Number.isFinite()` so the chip hides when HR is null or NaN.
- **`⚠ Hevy queued` badge on plans with no Hevy segments** — e.g. race day. Badge now hides when (a) plan status is completed/skipped, (b) plan has zero segments with `logging_target='hevy'`. Removed the legacy `daily_plans.hevy_routine_id` fallback path entirely.
- **Redundant Completed/Partial/Missed buttons on already-completed plans** — auto-rollup is the primary path now. When `plan.status === 'completed'`, only "Mark Partial" + Edit show, not the full triplet.

---

## [1.8.1] — 2026-05-03

### Removed — legacy code paths that confused Coach
Coach (Claude) reads the OpenAPI schema and skill files to decide what to write. As of v1.8.0 there were two ways to attach exercises to a day (the old `daily_plans.planned_exercises` flat field AND the new `plan_segments.planned_exercises` per-segment array) — Coach could go either way and the system would accept both. v1.8.1 forces a single canonical path so Coach can't pick wrong.

- **Removed** legacy fallback in `pushPlanToHevy()` that read `daily_plans.planned_exercises` when no segments existed. If a plan has no Hevy-target segments, push is a no-op (returns `skipped: 'no_segments_with_logging_target_hevy'`).
- **Removed** `mapPlanToHevyRoutine` helper (was a one-segment-fake wrapper for legacy callers).
- **Removed** `daily_plans.hevy_routine_id` mirror writes from Hevy push. The single source of truth is `plan_segments.hevy_routine_id`.
- **Removed** `planned_exercises` and `actual_exercises` from `WRITABLE_FIELDS` whitelist on `POST/PUT /api/daily-plans` — sending them is now silently ignored.
- **Removed** `legacyPlannedExercises` parameter from `syncSegmentsForPlan()`.
- **Removed** auto-populate's UNION with `daily_plans.planned_exercises` — only segments are scanned for unmapped exercise names.
- **Removed** stale Coach init prompt section (`public/app.js`) referencing Fitbod, `daily_plan.planned_exercises`, and `actual_exercises`. Replaced with v1.8.1 segments-based instructions.
- **Removed** dead `safeQuery('training_plans table', 'SELECT 1')` shim in `db.js` (table dropped long ago).
- **Removed** duplicate `daily_plans +planned_exercises` ALTER at `db.js:641`.
- **Updated** skills (morning-check-in, image-intake, amend-day) so all references point at segments.
- **Updated** `claude-schema.json`: dropped `DailyPlanCreate.planned_exercises` from request body. Added `required: [block_label, planned_exercises]` on segment items so Coach gets a validation error if it forgets either.

### Note — DB columns kept for backwards compat
The `daily_plans.planned_exercises`, `daily_plans.actual_exercises`, and `daily_plans.hevy_routine_id` columns are still in the schema (with deprecation comments). The one-time backfill migration that copied them into `plan_segments` still runs. Active code never writes to them. They will be dropped in v1.9.0 after one release of soak time.

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added — Plan segments + per-segment logging
- **`plan_segments` table** — daily_plan now decomposes into ordered segments (`block_label`, `block_order`, `logging_target`, `planned_exercises`, `target_duration_min`, `target_effort`, `hevy_routine_id`, `status`, `notes`). One plan can have N segments routed to different log targets (Hevy / Apple Health / manual).
- **`logging_target` per segment** — Coach picks where each block should be logged. Strength → Hevy, Z2 run → Apple Health, mobility → manual. Resolved via `utils/exerciseTaxonomy.js` when Coach doesn't set explicitly.
- **Per-segment Mark Done + notes** — Each segment block on the Today card now has Mark Done / In Progress / Skip buttons and a Notes prompt. Coach reads `segment.notes` in the end-of-day review (e.g. "ran too fast — HR drifted Z3", "weights too light, +5lb next week").
- **Auto-rollup of `daily_plan.status`** — When the last non-skipped segment marks completed, the day flips to completed automatically. Wrap Day still exists for end-of-day notes.
- **Workout auto-link** — Hevy / HAE / manual workouts now attach to today's plan + the matching `plan_segment_id` via FK. Replaces the old date-string heuristic.
- **`workouts.deleted_at`** — soft-delete tombstone so Hevy `DeletedWorkout` events don't lose plan-segment links.

### Added — Hevy two-way integration overhaul
- **`hevy_template_cache` table** — postgres-backed mirror of Hevy's ~4,300 exercise templates. `GET /api/hevy/exercise-templates?q=` now reads from this cache; lazy-refresh on first call or when older than 7 days. Catalog refresh uses `pageSize=100` (the spec's actual max) so a full refresh is ~43 calls instead of 433.
- **`hevy_exercise_map` table** — sticky AB Brain name → Hevy template binding. Push-plan resolves missing template IDs via map → cache exact → cache fuzzy (trgm). CRUD endpoints + auto-populate that buckets matches into mapped/ambiguous/unmapped.
- **Custom exercise auto-create** — `POST /api/hevy/exercise-map/auto-populate` accepts `auto_create_custom: true`. Unmapped names get title-cased, POSTed to Hevy's `/exercise_templates`, mapped, and cached in one pass.
- **`sync_state` cursor** — `POST /api/hevy/sync` now uses `/v1/workouts/events` (not paginated `/workouts`) so DELETIONS are captured as `DeletedWorkout` events. Cursor stored in `sync_state` table; survives restarts.
- **Body measurements bridge** — `POST /api/hevy/body-measurements/sync`. Pushes RENPHO `body_metrics` (weight_lb, fat_free_mass_lb, body_fat_pct) → Hevy `/v1/body_measurements` (weight_kg, lean_mass_kg, fat_percent). Merges with existing Hevy data first since PUT overwrites null. POST for new dates (PUT 404s on missing).
- **Conflict resolution per spec** — `/sync` UPSERT now lets Hevy win for sets/reps/weight/timing/volume; AB Brain wins for body_notes via reversed COALESCE.
- **`GET /api/hevy/health`** — verifies API key by hitting `/v1/user/info`. Settings page health-check button.
- **Routine title cleanup** — Drop emoji prefix and the GMT timezone string. Precedence: `daily_plans.hevy_routine_title` (override) → `daily_plans.title` → generated `"May 3 — Strength (Top)"`.
- **Today card chip per Hevy exercise** — Green "→ Hevy: <Title>" pill when template resolved, amber "⚠ unresolved" otherwise. Server enriches segments with `hevy_resolved_title` from cache.
- **Settings → Hevy section** — Six buttons: Health Check, Sample Catalog, Sync Workouts, Refresh Template Cache, Auto-Map Exercises, Sync Body Measurements.

### Fixed — Hevy API correctness (against verified OAS spec)
- **Custom exercise POST shape** — Wrapper is `exercise` (not `exercise_template`). Fields are `muscle_group` (not `primary_muscle_group`), `equipment_category` (not `equipment`), `exercise_type` (required). Previous shape would have 400'd.
- **Routine PUT body** — `PutRoutinesRequestBody` does NOT accept `folder_id`. Strip it before update calls or Hevy rejects.
- **UserInfo unwrap** — Hevy returns `{ data: { id, name, url } }`. Health check now reads `resp.data` properly so the user's display name surfaces.
- **CustomExerciseType enum** — Real values are `bodyweight_reps` / `bodyweight_assisted_reps` (not `weighted_bodyweight` / `assisted_bodyweight`). Schema doc updated so Coach picks valid types.
- **Template refresh perf** — `/templates/refresh` previously ran 4,300 individual INSERTs in a tight loop (~30-90s). Now batches into chunks of 200 inside a transaction (~2-5s).
- **Workout sync misses deletions** — Old code used `GET /workouts?page=N` filtered by start_time client-side. Switched to `GET /workouts/events?since=<cursor>` which emits `UpdatedWorkout` + `DeletedWorkout` types. Deletions now soft-delete via `workouts.deleted_at`.
- **Body measurements field names** — Verified against Hevy OAS: `weight_kg`, `lean_mass_kg`, `fat_percent` (no `muscle_mass_kg`, `bone_mass_kg`, `water_percent`, `bmi`, `bmr_kcal`, `visceral_fat_rating` — all of those would 400 from Hevy's strict validator).
- **`folder_id` field name regression** — Locked in tests/hevy.test.js. Body sent to Hevy must contain `folder_id`, NOT `routine_folder_id` (the May 3 production bug).

### Added — Tests
- **`npm test`** — node:test suite (zero deps, built into Node 18+). 12 regression tests cover: folder_id field name, `HEVY_ROUTINE_FOLDER_ID` env fallback, title cleanup, lb→kg rounding, abMetricsToHevy real schema (asserts invented fields are NOT in payload), mapHevyWorkoutToAB shape.

---

## [1.7.1] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Transcript Splitting** — AI-powered detection and splitting of long Bee recordings that contain multiple distinct conversations. Uses multi-signal analysis: time gaps between utterances, speaker set transitions (sliding window), active speaker windows, and GPT-4o-mini topic/context boundary detection.
- **Ambient Noise Detection** — each detected segment classified as "primary" (user actively participating) or "ambient" (background chatter, airport noise, overheard strangers). Ambient segments tagged separately for filtering.
- **Auto-Flag Long Recordings** — transcripts exceeding 60 minutes or 500 utterances are automatically tagged `needs-split-review` during Bee sync. Shown with "Needs Split" badge in transcript list.
- **Split Analysis API** — `POST /api/transcripts/:id/analyze-splits` pre-computes signal layers (time gaps, speaker transitions, speaker windows) and sends them with sampled utterances to GPT-4o-mini for holistic boundary detection.
- **Split Execution API** — `POST /api/transcripts/:id/split` creates new transcript records per segment, copies utterances with re-indexed positions, queues speaker identification for primary segments, and marks the original as `split-parent`.
- **Needs-Split Review API** — `GET /api/transcripts/needs-split` lists all flagged transcripts not yet split.
- **Split UI** — "Analyze & Split" button on long transcript detail view. Shows AI-detected segments with title, speakers, relevance badge, and confidence. Confirm button executes split and links to child transcripts.

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Known Contacts System** — new `contacts` table storing name, aliases (JSONB), email, phone, relationship, organization, confidentiality tier (open/confidential/restricted), and metadata. CRUD API at `/api/contacts` with list, search, create, update, delete endpoints.
- **Contact-Aware Speaker Identification** — `autoIdentifySpeakers` now queries the contacts table before calling GPT-4o-mini. When contacts exist, known names are injected as "CONFIRMED KNOWN CONTACTS" in the prompt, using the proven hints-based identification pattern. Resolved speakers are linked to contact IDs via `metadata.contact_links`.
- **Unrecognized Speaker Detection** — after speaker identification, names that don't match any contact are stored in `metadata.unrecognized_speakers`. New `GET /api/contacts/unrecognized` endpoint returns distinct unrecognized names across all transcripts with frequency counts, sorted by most common.
- **Contacts Management UI** — new "Known Contacts" section in Settings with contact list, add form (name, aliases, relationship, organization), delete button, and "Unrecognized Speakers" panel showing names from transcripts with one-tap "Add as contact" flow.

---

## [1.6.1] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Bee Transcript Sync (Full Sync & Sync Updates)** — The Bee API `/v1/conversations` endpoint requires `created_after`/`created_before` date filter parameters to reliably return conversation data. Added these filters to `/sync` and `/sync-chunk` endpoints, matching the working `/sync-conversations` pattern.
- **Incremental Sync Transcript Gap** — The `/v1/changes` feed doesn't reliably report conversation updates. Added a supplementary 7-day date-range conversation fetch to `/sync-incremental`, so both the "Sync Updates" button and the 30-minute cron job now pick up new transcripts.
- **Conversation API Timeouts** — Increased conversation list and detail fetch timeouts from 30s to 60s across all sync endpoints to prevent silent failures on slower responses.
- **Login Page Version** — Updated hardcoded version on login page from v1.2.0 to current.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Morning Briefing Endpoint** — `GET /api/briefing` returns a complete markdown morning briefing with smart task ranking, recovery readiness, rings/streaks, yesterday's activity, stale alerts, and today's plan. Designed for Claude Projects, Claude Code, and ChatGPT to call on-demand.
  - **Smart Task Ranking** — scores each task by priority (urgent=40, high=30, medium=20, low=10) + due urgency (overdue=50, today=30, this week=15) + staleness (>14d=+15, >7d=+10) + waiting duration (>5d=+10, >3d=+5). Top 3 Focus shown first.
  - **Stale Task Detection** — flags tasks untouched for 7+ days in briefing output
  - **Recovery Summary** — sleep, recovery score, injury status, workout fatigue
  - **Rings & Streaks** — train/execute/recover streak counts
  - **Yesterday Recap** — completed tasks, workout, nutrition totals
  - **Today's Plan** — daily plan if set, including workout/nutrition targets
  - Added to `claude-schema.json` and `openapi-chatgpt.json` for Custom GPT integration
- **Today View: Top 3 Focus** — new section at the top of Today view showing the 3 highest-scored tasks with highlighted cards, priority badges, and score indicators
- **Today View: Stale Tasks** — new section showing tasks untouched 7+ days with "Snooze 1w" and "Archive" quick actions

### Removed
- **Server-side Outlook email sync** — replaced by Claude's Outlook MCP tools
- **Agent system (Jarvis)** — roster, org chart, work board, agent CRUD, auto-seed. Removed as Claude Code handles delegation natively. The `ai_agent` field on tasks remains for source tracking.

### Fixed
- **`GET /api/exercises/available` SQL binding error** — query passed equipment array as parameter but had no `$1` placeholder. Fixed with `WHERE equipment = ANY($1::text[]) OR equipment IS NULL`. Same fix applied to `GET /api/exercises/for-profile/:profileId`.

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-29

### Deprecated
- **Agents Section** — removed in v1.6.0. Agent personas (Jarvis, Cascade, Scout, Forge, Pixel, Sentinel) added management overhead without execution value. Claude Code handles task delegation natively.

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Task Management Overhaul** — fully editable tasks with comments, checklists, and history
  - **Editable title, description, notes, next_steps** — all fields are now inline-editable in the task detail modal (blur to save)
  - **Task Comments** — timestamped comments on any task with add/delete. New `task_comments` table with cascade delete. Comment count shown on task cards.
  - **Checklist/Subtasks** — JSONB checklist items `[{id, text, done}]` with checkbox toggle, add/remove. Progress shown as "3/5" on task cards.
  - **completed_at timestamp** — auto-set to `NOW()` when task moves to "done", cleared when re-opened. Displayed in task detail modal.
  - **Task History** — collapsible activity history in task detail modal showing all status transitions with timestamps.
  - **Notes field** — quick-capture notes field on tasks (separate from description). Available in both create and edit views.
  - **Tags** — JSONB tags column added to tasks (matching pattern from knowledge, workouts, meals). API-ready, UI in next phase.
  - **Today Focus View** — ADHD-friendly daily task view as default tab. Shows: Overdue (red), Due Today (yellow), In Progress (blue), Up Next (top 5 from backlog), Completed Today (green). Quick-action Start/Done buttons on each card.
  - **Smart Sort** — sort dropdown on list view: Priority, Due Date, Created, Updated, Status. Client-side sorting with secondary sort by priority.
  - **Checklist & Comment Badges** — list view now shows checklist progress (e.g. "3/5") and comment count on task cards.
  - **Quick Reschedule** — overdue tasks show one-tap reschedule buttons: Today, Tomorrow, Monday, or pick a date. Bulk "All → Today" / "All → Tomorrow" for all overdue at once. Task detail modal also has quick reschedule shortcuts (Today, Tmrw, Mon, +1wk) below the date picker.
  - **Waiting On Others** — new task status "waiting_on" with a `waiting_on` field to track who you're blocked by. Tasks grouped by person in Today view (e.g. all 5 Adin tasks together for one follow-up). Kanban board has dedicated "Waiting On" column. Prompt auto-appears when setting status. Auto-cleared when moving to another status.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **TSB calculation completely overhauled** — values were unrealistically negative (-336 on a rest day)
  - **Correct EWMA decay constants**: ATL uses `exp(-1/7) ≈ 0.867`, CTL uses `exp(-1/42) ≈ 0.976`. Previous values (`2/(N+1)`) caused massive spikes and slow decay.
  - **Standard session-RPE load**: `effort × duration` (linear, per sports science). Initial attempt at `effort^1.5` produced loads too large (1350 for one session).
  - **Recovery sessions excluded**: walk/yoga/stretch/recovery at effort ≤4 no longer count as training stress.
  - **Duration capped at 180 min**: catches bad data (600-min "dog walks") and unrealistic parses.
  - **TSB scoring rescaled with sports-science labels**: detraining (>+10, score 60), fresh (+10 to -10, score 90), optimal (-10 to -30, score 100), productive (-30 to -60, score 75), accumulated fatigue (-60 to -100, score 50), overreaching (-100 to -150, score 30), danger (<-150, score 15). Previous scale flagged -80 as "danger" — now correctly labeled "accumulated fatigue" at score 50.
- **Gym profiles POST 503 error** — table had `equipment TEXT[]` (array) from wrong branch deployment. Migration now drops and recreates as `JSONB`. Also migrated `is_active` → `is_primary` column.
- **Duplicate gym profile routes removed** — was in both `routes/exercises.js` and `routes/gym-profiles.js`. Now only in `gym-profiles.js` at `/api/gym-profiles`.
- **Import-fitbod route fixed** — referenced non-existent columns (`name_normalized`, `muscle_primary`, `muscle_secondary`). Updated to use actual schema (`name`, `primary_muscle_groups`, `secondary_muscle_groups`).
- **Duplicate table definitions removed from db.js** — merge brought in second exercises/gym_profiles CREATE TABLE with wrong column types. Removed to prevent startup failures.

### Added
- **Documentation & Version History in Settings** — collapsible sections: How It Works, Key Concepts (recovery score, TSB, muscle freshness, rings, schema builder), Architecture Decisions, and full version history v1.0–v1.3.
- **Gym profiles debug endpoint** — `GET /api/gym-profiles/debug/schema` shows live table column types for diagnostics.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Recovery Score v2** — completely rebuilt with sports-science-backed methodology
  - **TSB-based Training Load** (TrainingPeaks model) — compares 7-day fatigue (ATL) to 42-day fitness (CTL) using session-RPE (effort × duration). Replaces naive 3-day average. Properly reflects progressive overload blocks.
  - **Effort-aware Muscle Freshness** — high-effort workouts now need up to 1.5× longer recovery time. A brutal effort-9 session needs ~72h, not just 48h.
  - **Blended Nutrition** — yesterday 70% + today 30%. Capped at 85 if no meals logged today. Shows both days.
  - **Recovery Score Explainer** — collapsible "What is this?" section on both fitness day and recovery views explaining all components.
- **Proper numeric workout columns** — `duration_minutes`, `distance_value`, `elevation_gain_ft`, `hr_avg`, `hr_max`, `cadence`, `cal_active`, `cal_total`. Auto-parsed from text fields on save, with SQL migration backfilling all historical data.
- **Exercise Library** — 65 seeded exercises with exact Fitbod naming, muscle groups, and equipment requirements
  - `POST /exercises/import-fitbod` — smart import that auto-detects 4 CSV formats (exercise library, Fitbod details, workout exports, tab-separated)
  - Normalizes muscle names to recovery schema (e.g. "Quads" → quadriceps, "front delts" → shoulders)
  - Upserts: duplicates enriched, not created
- **Gym Profiles** — Home/Gym/Travel equipment profiles with 42 equipment types matching Fitbod categories
  - Checkbox picker UI in Fitness tab (gear icon)
  - Coach checks active profile before planning workouts
  - `GET /exercises/available` — exercises filtered to active profile's equipment
- **Equipment Catalog** — 42 equipment types organized by category (free weights, machines, benches, racks, accessories, cardio, bodyweight)
- **Plan-Workout Connection** — plans and workouts formally linked
  - `daily_plans.planned_exercises` JSONB — structured exercise array from coach
  - `daily_plans.actual_exercises` JSONB — what was actually done (from Fitbod screenshots)
  - `daily_plans.completion_notes` — coach's review after workout
  - `workouts.daily_plan_id` FK — links workout to its plan (legacy data backfilled by date match)
  - Recovery reads structured exercises for granular per-muscle tracking (falls back to workout_type for pre-March 2026 data)
- **Today's Plan card** — enhanced UI showing structured exercises grouped by warmup/main/superset/circuit/finisher, with status icons (✓/~/✗), PR badges, set-level detail, coach notes, and planned-vs-actual comparison
- **Workout Notes display** — plan card shows workout_notes in monospace block for Fitbod transcription reference
- **Fitbod CSV import in Settings** — Settings → Fitness & Gym section with multi-file upload support
- **Fitbod screenshot logging instructions** — coach knows how to read Fitbod screenshots, handle band resistance labels (keep as-is, don't convert to lbs), mark PRs, use exact exercise names

### Changed
- **Coach must specify exact weights** — instructions updated: "Do NOT write 'build to heavy' — give a number: '3x10 @ 50 lb'"
- **Duration parsing** — handles MM:SS vs HH:MM ambiguity (52:30 = 52 min, not 52 hours). Caps at 300 min.
- **Recovery component detail** — Score Breakdown now shows detail text below each bar (TSB values, meal data, muscle status)
- **Claude schema** — all exercise, gym profile, and equipment endpoints documented. DailyPlanCreate schema includes planned_exercises, actual_exercises, completion_notes.
- **All OpenAPI schemas updated** — claude-schema.yaml/json, openapi-everything.json, openapi-spartan.json, openapi-chatgpt.json, openapi-gpt-actions.yaml now include numeric workout fields and exercise/gym endpoints.
- **Version bumped** to 1.3.0

### Fixed
- **TSB calculation NaN** — `time_duration` stored as text ("45 min") caused `Number("45 min") = NaN`, zeroing out CTL/ATL. Fixed with proper numeric columns and text parsing.
- **Duration backfill** — "52:30" was parsed as 52 hours (3150 min) instead of 52 minutes. Fixed HH:MM vs MM:SS detection.
- **Recovery score inflated** — was 81 "Peak" during progressive overload. Now ~70 "Good" with TSB properly reflecting accumulated training stress.

---

- **CHANGELOG.md** — full version history with commentary
- **Claude schema files** — `claude-schema.yaml` and `claude-schema.json` published for Claude AI integration
- Health-check endpoint now returns `version` field

### Fixed
- **Fitness Today crash** — `hasCheckIn` variable was used but never declared, causing "Can't find variable: hasCheckIn" error when viewing any date in the Fitness tab
- **Settings health-check** — frontend was calling `/api/health` (non-existent); corrected to `/api/health-check`

---

- **ChatGPT import** — bulk import conversations.json exports with dedup

### Changed
- **Daily context simplified** — reduced to 4 fields: sleep_hours, sleep_quality, hydration_liters, notes (removed energy_rating, hunger_rating, recovery_rating, body_weight_lb, cravings, digestion, day_type)
- **Rings made proportional** — Fuel and Recover rings now fill proportionally instead of binary on/off
- **Training plans dropped** — `training_plans` table removed; all planning uses `daily_plans` with auto-migration
- **OpenAPI specs synced** — all 4 spec variants updated to match actual backend schema
- **ChatGPT OpenAPI trimmed** to 30 endpoints (Custom GPT limit)

### Fixed
- Recovery score NaN bug from Date object concatenation
